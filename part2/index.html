							<h2>Bacci Ball</h2>
							<p>Bacci aka "Bacci Bear" or "Bitchy" is the cutest little muffin you will ever see. He's a maltese so he is super tiny. He can be pretty "bitchy" sometimes considering he is now an old man pushing the age of 18 years old.(human years) But he has recently warmed up to me a couple of years ago.</p>
                            <p>I call him my adopted child because he was not intially mine. When my mom got married her husband Russ, had Bacci. So technically I did not raise him and I got him through their marriage. But that does not mean I don't love him all the same. He is pretty stand-offish but when he warms up to you, he lets you pet him and pick him up. In the most recent years we have noticed him becoming a little more friendly after watching Oreo get so much love and attention. If he really likes you, he'll come over when you walk in and give u a single lick. I find it relevant to a little kid coming up to you, and feeling forced to give you a hug and then running away. Same thing. </p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Location</h2>
							<p>You can find Bacci either getting his weekly bath down the basement or sleeping in the kitchen. He really loves to sleep.He also loves to poop and pee all over the kitchen floor.I think my mom and Russ have accepted it because hes really old so sometimes our kitchen which is SUPER CLEAN smells like a barnyard with these two old goats running around.</p>
							<p>They are only allowed to live in the kitchen for this bathroom reason. But they are so happy in there because everyone is always in the kitchen.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Friendships</h2>
							<p>Bacci doesn't have any friends. Well he has our housekeeper Homero who is his best friend / caretaker. Homero is the only one who can throw Bacci around without Bacci getting upset.</p>
							<p>Oreo is his love / hate frined. When Oreo is gone Bacci gets upset but when Oreo is around and barking Bacci gets upset with Oreo and starts parking at him. Same with when Oreo is running around the kitchen, playing with him ball, Bacci comes barking his little raspy voice.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Funny Fact / Story</h2>
							<p>As I said before bacci always runs after Oreo when Oreo is barking or playing ball etc. So when bacci gets really upset, to prove his point he rams into Oreo head first. It is the funniest thing to see because Bacci is like 5 pounds and Oreo is 30. So Oreo doesn't even more. Then when Bacci sees that the only dog that got hurt out of his head-butt was him, he runs back to his bed in shame. It is actually so cute.</p>

							<h2>Picture</h2>
                          <p>This is a picture of Bacci and Oreo laying in their beds in the kitchen. If you can't tell Oreo is alittle small for his bed while Bacci is in a king sized bed. This picture describes Bacci and oreo perfectly because Bacci is the dominant figure while Oreo is more laid back. Bacci is actually in Oreo's bed and so Oreo just got into Bacci's small bed. Those two are a mess but so cute!</p>

							<h2>Oreo Mortelliti</h2>
							<p>Oreo Mortelliti is a 15 year old Boston Terrier. He is my child and I love him so much. When I was younger, like before middle school, I would tell EVERYONE about my dog. At my old school Strafford friends everyone in the class including the teachers would have to draw a picture of someting of your choice. Of course I said dogs. I guess I talked about Oreo so much that almost everyone tried drawing a boston terrier.</p>
							<p>Oreo is very affectionate and I blame this on me...and he gets sad when you leave him. I think thats the worst part of leaving the house is that he gives you puppy eyes when you close the door. I always want to stuff him in my bag and take him wherever I go. He is also very good with children. I am the oldest out of my cousins so they torture him when they come over but he takes it. He's my little baby and I am so happy he's mine!</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Location</h2>
							<p>You can find Oreo on a regular basis laying in the sun on the floor in our kitchen, or sprawled out across his bed. he sleeps most of the day away and gives a good 15 min a day to running around. He's old now, so he gets tired more quickly.</p>
							<p>You can sometimes find him in the living room, where he knows he's not suppose to be. But I secretly let him in there with me to snuggle. (don't tell my mom) </p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<h2>Friendships</h2>
							<p>Oreo had a couple friends. He had one in particular best friend and his name was Max. Max would sneak over when he ran away from his house and they would play in our back yard together. Max was a Jack Russell Terrier. They were cute little friends and when he went missing his owners would always know where to find him.</p>
							<p>Like I said in Bacci's information, Oreo and Bacci have a love hate relationship. Oreo will put up with all Bacci's misfits for a certaint amount of time before coming annoyed.But oreo rarely gets mad but when he does, Bacci goes running into his safe haven, (his cage.) Which is strange because usually dogs don't like their cages but Bacci does. </p>

							<h2>Funny Fact / Story</h2>
							<p>This is more of an embarrassing story on my part BUT oreo was my ever first dog that was mine. My mom didn't want to get another dog, (we had this dog named nicky but he was evil and like bit everyone) but we had a pet store around the corner so me and my little friends would go and play with the dogs. So I found oreo and we played together and he just like snuffled in my ear and cuddled me and I was sold. For some reason I started peeing my bed every night and then finally my dad was like lets go get him. So me and my dad went and brought home a Oreo and then after that I stopped peeing the bed.</p>
							<p>So strange but it is a true story. I am so happy we did go get Oreo because he is the best dog ever for me. I have kind of turned him into a sissy but whatever he doesn't need to be tough. All the time he just wants love and affection. In our old house when he was younger and could control his bladder, I used to have him sleep with me in my bed. I would tuck him in under the covers and he would pass out like a human--so stinkin cute!</p>
